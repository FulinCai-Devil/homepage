I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in computer engineering at Arizona State University under the supervision of [Prof. Teresa Wu](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/twu/). He is a Graduate Research Assistant with the ASU-Mayo Center for Innovative Imaging, at Arizona State University. He is particularly interested in leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to enhance medical applications and improve healthcare outcomes. His current research interests include deep learning, biomedical signals, radar sensing, and health informatics.
