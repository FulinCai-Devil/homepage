I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Arizona State University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Teresa Wu](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/twu/). Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned both my master’s and bachelor’s degrees from Shenzhen University. Currently, I serve as a Graduate Research Assistant at the ASU-Mayo Center for Innovative Imaging. My research focuses on advancing deep learning techniques to enhance medical applications and improve healthcare outcomes, with a particular interest in deep learning, biomedical signal processing (specializing in physiological and radar sensors), and health informatics.
