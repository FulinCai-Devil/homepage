I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Arizona State University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Teresa Wu](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/twu/). I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the ASU-Mayo Center for Innovative Imaging. My research is centered on developing advanced deep learning techniques to enhance medical applications and improve healthcare outcomes. My current interests include deep learning, biomedical signal processing (focusing on physiological and radar sensors), and health informatics.
